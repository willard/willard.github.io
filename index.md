<p>Over the last 10 years, I have developed a wide range of websites using <strong>Linux, Apache MySQL and PHP ( LAMP )</strong>. As a Full Stack Developer I am able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application, I am knowledgeable in every level of how the web works, from setting up linux server, writing server-side APIs using PHP, working on client-side JavaScript for powering an application and converting PSD to HTML/WordPress Theme.</p>
<p>For the past 5 years, most of my works are WordPress related. From setting up the web server to theme development. As part of website maintenance I also do the updating of website content, adding or building a new plugin, and website optimization.</p> 
<p>As the technology change faster, I can adapt to the new changes, for now i'm starting to work with Laravel Framework and VueJS. And planning to use Google’s Flutter, a Mobile UI Framework‎ for building iOS and Android application.</p>
